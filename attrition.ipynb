A better metric would be precision, recall, or F1-score, which provide more insight into model performance when predicting rare events like attrition.  For the Department prediction, accuracy might be reasonable since departments likely have a more balanced distribution.\n","2. Department prediction: Since department classification is a multi-class problem (one employee belongs to one of several departments), softmax ensures that the model outputs probabilities summing to 1 across all department categories.  Attrition prediction: Since the attrition column was one-hot encoded (likely for a binary classification problem), softmax still works but could be replaced with sigmoid for a more direct probability output.\n","3. Use different evaluation metrics: Incorporate precision, recall, and F1-score to better evaluate performance on imbalanced data like attrition."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ZuQWjGgGXZ3C"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.-1.-1"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
